---

### Phase 3: Critical Bugs Fixed ✅

#### Bug #1: Downtime Display Not Showing ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Users couldn't see how long devices were down
**Root Cause:** API endpoint not returning `down_since` field

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `routers/devices.py` line 311
- Added: `"down_since": device.down_since.isoformat() if device.down_since else None`
- Commit: `d0f31a9`

**Verification:**
```json
{
  "hostid": "528fa608-a297-45f9-a608-f6019b37274a",
  "name": "Telavi-2-ATM",
  "ping_status": "Down",
  "down_since": "2025-10-20T19:49:11.947825"  // ✅ NOW PRESENT
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Frontend now displays "Down 2h 15m" format

---

#### Bug #2: Device Edit IP Conflict Error ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Editing device IP showed false conflict with itself
**Root Cause:** IP uniqueness check didn't exclude current device

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `routers/devices_standalone.py` line 315
- Changed: `if existing:` → `if existing and str(existing.id) != device_id:`
- Commit: `b0e21ba`

**Verification:** Device updates work without false IP conflicts

---

#### Bug #3: Regions Dropdown Empty ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Could not filter or assign regions
**Root Cause:** SQL queries not wrapped in `text()` for SQLAlchemy 2.0

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `routers/branches.py` - Multiple locations
- Added: `from sqlalchemy import text` + wrapped all raw SQL
- Commit: `c1f6eb8`

**Verification:** 10 regions now populate correctly

---

#### Bug #4: Worker Not Tracking State Transitions ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** down_since timestamps not being set
**Root Cause:** Worker container running old code

**Fix Applied:**
- Rebuilt worker container with latest code
- Container now has state transition tracking
- Verified with: `grep "went DOWN" /app/monitoring/tasks.py`

**Verification:**
- Worker processing 1,403 tasks in 5 minutes
- down_since column exists in database

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **2 Down Devices Without Timestamps**
