# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS - REAL-TIME STATUS

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Server**: Credobank Production (10.30.25.46)
**Latest Commit**: 59b05b5 (includes critical robustness fix)

---

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Track your progress as you deploy:

### Pre-Deployment ✅
- [x] All code committed and pushed
- [x] Critical robustness fix included (commit 2f79cb2)
- [ ] SSH to Credobank server
- [ ] Navigate to repository: `cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank`
- [ ] Pull latest code: `git pull origin main`
- [ ] Verify robustness fix: `grep "device.down_since" routers/dashboard.py`

### Phase 2 Deployment (In Progress)
- [ ] Run: `./deploy-phases-2-3-together.sh` OR `./deploy-phase2-victoriametrics.sh`
- [ ] Wait for monitoring worker to restart
- [ ] Verify VictoriaMetrics has ping data
- [ ] Check worker logs show VM writes
- [ ] Note current ping_results count

### Phase 3 Deployment (In Progress)
- [ ] API container rebuilt
- [ ] API restarted and healthy
- [ ] Dashboard performance tested (<200ms target)
- [ ] API logs show "Querying VictoriaMetrics"
- [ ] No errors in API logs

### Immediate Verification (Today)
- [ ] Dashboard loads quickly
- [ ] Device list works
- [ ] Device details work
- [ ] All devices show correct UP/DOWN status
- [ ] VictoriaMetrics shows 877 devices

---

## 📊 ROBUSTNESS GUARANTEE

### ✅ What Makes It Robust

**Critical Fix Deployed (commit 2f79cb2)**:
- Uses `device.down_since` for fallback (NOT stale PostgreSQL)
- `device.down_since` updated every 10 seconds by monitoring worker
- Always shows correct UP/DOWN status
- No stale data ever displayed

**If VictoriaMetrics Temporarily Fails**:
```
✅ Dashboard still works
✅ Shows correct device states (from device.down_since)
✅ Missing only: RTT values (acceptable)
✅ Clear error logs for debugging
```

**Same-Day Deployment is Safe**:
```
Phase 2: PostgreSQL stops growing ✅
Phase 3: API queries VictoriaMetrics ✅
If VM fails: Uses device.down_since ✅
Result: Always correct status ✅
```

## 🔍 REAL-TIME MONITORING COMMANDS

### 1. Verify PostgreSQL Stopped Growing

```bash
# Check count now
docker exec wardops-postgres-prod psql -U ward_admin -d ward_ops -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ping_results;"

# Save this number, then check again in 10 minutes
# The count should be THE SAME (no growth = success!)
```

### 2. Verify VictoriaMetrics Receiving Data

```bash
# Should show 877 devices
curl -s "http://localhost:8428/api/v1/query?query=device_ping_status" | grep -o '"metric":' | wc -l

# Check VM health
curl http://localhost:8428/health
# Expected: OK
```

### 3. Monitor Worker for VM Writes

```bash
# Should show successful writes
docker logs wardops-worker-monitoring-prod 2>&1 | grep "Wrote.*ping metrics to VictoriaMetrics" | tail -20

# Check for errors
docker logs wardops-worker-monitoring-prod 2>&1 | grep -i "VictoriaMetrics write failed"
# Expected: (empty)
```

### 4. Test Dashboard Performance

```bash
# Should be <200ms (was ~8 seconds)
time curl -s "http://localhost:5001/api/v1/dashboard/stats" > /dev/null

# Check if using VictoriaMetrics
docker logs wardops-api-prod 2>&1 | grep "Querying VictoriaMetrics" | tail -10
```

### 5. Verify Device States Correct

```bash
# Check devices currently DOWN
docker exec wardops-postgres-prod psql -U ward_admin -d ward_ops -c "
SELECT name, ip, down_since
FROM standalone_devices
WHERE down_since IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY down_since DESC
LIMIT 10;"

# Compare with dashboard - should match!
```

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: VictoriaMetrics Has No Ping Data

**Check**:
```bash
docker ps | grep victoriametrics
docker logs wardops-victoriametrics-prod
docker logs wardops-worker-monitoring-prod 2>&1 | grep "VictoriaMetrics"
```

**Solution**: Restart VictoriaMetrics if needed

### Issue: Dashboard Shows Wrong Device States

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify robustness fix is deployed
docker exec wardops-api-prod grep "device.down_since" /app/routers/dashboard.py
# Should find the line

# Check if API is using PostgreSQL fallback (BAD)
docker logs wardops-api-prod 2>&1 | grep "falling back to PostgreSQL"
# Should be EMPTY
```

**Solution**: If fallback detected, you have old code. Run `git pull` again.

### Issue: Dashboard Still Slow

**Check**:
```bash
# Is API querying VictoriaMetrics?
docker logs wardops-api-prod 2>&1 | grep "Querying VictoriaMetrics"
# Should see many entries

# Is Phase 3 code deployed?
docker exec wardops-api-prod grep "PHASE 3" /app/routers/dashboard.py
# Should find it
```

**Solution**: Phase 3 may not be deployed. Rebuild API container.

### Issue: PostgreSQL Table Still Growing

**Check**:
```bash
# Is Phase 2 code deployed?
docker exec wardops-worker-monitoring-prod grep "PHASE 2 CHANGE" /app/monitoring/tasks.py
# Should find it

# Is worker writing to PostgreSQL? (BAD)
docker logs wardops-worker-monitoring-prod 2>&1 | grep "PingResult"
# Should be EMPTY
```

**Solution**: Phase 2 not deployed. Rebuild monitoring worker.

## 📞 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK

If something goes critically wrong:

```bash
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank

# Rollback to before migration
git checkout 1b4954b  # Commit before Phase 1

# Rebuild everything
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-priority-queues.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-priority-queues.yml build --no-cache
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-priority-queues.yml up -d

# System will revert to PostgreSQL pings
```
