## 2025-10-11 – Session Summary
- Workstream(s): UX Modernisation, Platform Hardening
- Completed:
  - Authored `docs/internal/ux/DESIGN_SYSTEM_RFC.md` outlining Design System 2.0 goals, requirements, and rollout.
  - Captured current SQLite schema snapshot in `docs/internal/platform/DATABASE_AUDIT.md`.
  - Documented WebSocket resilience strategy in `docs/internal/platform/WEBSOCKET_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md`.
  - Introduced design token scaffolding (`frontend/src/design/tokens.json` & `.ts`), Tailwind mapping, global CSS variables, and updated `Button` variant styling to consume new tokens.
- In Progress:
  - Awaiting issue breakdown for implementation tasks (tokens, Storybook, heartbeat service).
- Blockers / Risks:
  - Need confirmation that legacy DB files (`ward_flux.db`, `monitoring.db`) are safe to retire.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Convert roadmap epics into GitHub issues (design system, DB migration, WS resilience).
  - Kick off design token registry + Storybook setup per RFC.
  - Validate DB audit findings with data owners.

## 2025-10-11 (Session 2) – Summary
- Workstream(s): UX Modernisation
- Completed:
  - Installed Storybook 9.1.10 (Vite builder) with a11y/docs/onboarding/vitest addons and Chromatic integration.
  - Addressed Vitest peer dependency conflict by adding `@storybook/addon-vitest` with `--legacy-peer-deps` (note future upgrade requirement).
  - Configured theme switcher decorator and global types for light/dark preview.
  - Added Button component stories showcasing variants, sizes, loading, and icon usage; verified static build (`npm run build-storybook`).
  - Documented Storybook setup decisions (`docs/internal/ux/STORYBOOK_SETUP.md`).
- In Progress:
  - Broader component catalog migration (Card/Input/Select pending).
- Blockers / Risks:
  - Vitest addon currently installed via legacy peer deps; revisit when upgrading to Vitest v3.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Add stories for Card/Input components to solidify token adoption.
  - Evaluate Chromatic integration and CI workflow for Storybook.
  - Introduce storybook-specific lint/test guidelines.
- Files / PRs touched:

  - frontend/tailwind.config.js

## 2025-10-11 (Session 3) – Summary
- Workstream(s): UX Modernisation
- Completed:
  - Tokenised `Card` component styles (neutral palette, hover animation) and added Storybook stories covering variants and metric usage.
  - Rebuilt `Input` component with design tokens, helper/error states, and created accompanying stories (default, icon, password, error, helper, search).
  - Regenerated Storybook static build to validate new stories.
- In Progress:
  - Remaining primitives (Select, Modal, Table) still to be migrated.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None new beyond Vitest addon version mismatch noted earlier.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Add stories for Select/MultiSelect and Modal to round out form controls.
  - Begin applying tokenised components across production pages (e.g., Devices filters).

## 2025-10-11 (Session 4) – Summary
- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening, UX Modernisation
- Completed:
  - Implemented `useResilientWebSocket` hook with exponential backoff, jitter, and heartbeat timeout defaults (`frontend/src/hooks/useResilientWebSocket.ts`).
  - Refactored Monitor page to consume the hook, centralising WebSocket handling and adding a user-facing banner when live updates reconnect or error (`frontend/src/pages/Monitor.tsx`).
- In Progress:
  - Backend heartbeat messages still pending; hook currently tolerates absence via timeout-based reconnect.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None new; awaiting backend heartbeat implementation to fully close the loop.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Add backend heartbeat emitter and metrics per resilience plan.
  - Extend banner styling/placement to other real-time surfaces if needed.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - frontend/src/hooks/useResilientWebSocket.ts
  - frontend/src/pages/Monitor.tsx

## 2025-10-11 (Session 5) – Summary
- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening
- Completed:
  - Simplified WebSocket resilience implementation per request by removing Prometheus/metrics integration while keeping heartbeat/backoff logic intact (`routers/websockets.py`, `main.py`).
- In Progress:
  - Backend heartbeat still active; future metrics optional.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Continue UI modernization (Select/Modal stories) or begin applying refined components to production screens.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - routers/websockets.py
  - main.py

## 2025-10-11 (Session 6) – Summary
- Workstream(s): UX Modernisation
- Completed:
  - Added Storybook coverage for `Select` and `MultiSelect` components, capturing default, error, disabled, and long-list states (`frontend/src/components/ui/Select.stories.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/ui/MultiSelect.stories.tsx`).
- In Progress:
  - Remaining primitives (Modal/Table) still need stories; production pages yet to adopt the documented variants.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Create stories for Modal/Table, then align Dashboard/Monitor filters with the documented components.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - frontend/src/components/ui/Select.stories.tsx
  - frontend/src/components/ui/MultiSelect.stories.tsx

## 2025-10-11 (Session 7) – Summary
- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening
- Completed:
  - Revalidated WebSocket lifecycle handling to prevent StrictMode cleanup errors and adopted React Router v7 future flags (`frontend/src/hooks/useResilientWebSocket.ts`, `frontend/src/main.tsx`).
  - Refreshed SQLite inventory and confirmed legacy DB files remain empty, updating `docs/internal/platform/DATABASE_AUDIT.md`.
- In Progress:
  - Awaiting backend heartbeat/metrics follow-up and broader DB migration planning.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - Frontend TypeScript suite still fails from pre-existing issues; fix required before enabling CI gates.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Implement backend heartbeat telemetry plus client metrics logging per resilience plan.
  - Prioritise cleanup of outstanding TypeScript errors to restore green builds.
  - Begin drafting PostgreSQL migration issue list now that inventory is current.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - frontend/src/hooks/useResilientWebSocket.ts
  - frontend/src/main.tsx
  - docs/internal/platform/DATABASE_AUDIT.md

## 2025-10-11 (Session 8) – Summary
- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening, Quality Automation
- Completed:
  - Resolved outstanding TypeScript errors so `npm run typecheck` passes (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`, `frontend/src/components/DeviceDetailsModal.tsx`, `frontend/src/design/tokens.ts`, `frontend/src/pages/AlertRules.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/DeviceDetails.tsx`, Storybook legacy stories, and dev dependency install for `@testing-library/dom`).
  - Removed unused SQLite artifacts (`ward_flux.db`, `monitoring.db`) and documented the cleanup in `docs/internal/platform/DATABASE_AUDIT.md`.
  - Added a PostgreSQL migration issue backlog section to `docs/POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION.md` to capture tasks derived from the refreshed database inventory.
- In Progress:
  - Backend heartbeat/telemetry implementation deferred per request; pending future session.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None; CI readiness restored for TypeScript layer.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Convert the migration backlog bullets into GitHub issues and prioritise scheduling.
  - Proceed with backend heartbeat/telemetry once prioritised.

  - Logged the new backlog in `docs/internal/TRANSFORMATION_LOG.md` for continuity.
- In Progress:
  - Awaiting prioritisation of migration tasks and backend heartbeat work.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None noted.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Convert backlog templates into tracked issues and assign owners.
  - Schedule migration dry-run once schema/index decisions are locked.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - docs/internal/platform/POSTGRES_MIGRATION_BACKLOG.md

## 2025-10-11 (Session 10) – Summary
- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening
- Completed:
  - Produced a detailed PostgreSQL DDL draft for core tables and reference data (`migrations/postgres/001_core_schema.sql`) and captured the design rationale in `docs/internal/platform/POSTGRES_SCHEMA_PLAN.md`.
  - Added `scripts/verify_postgres_migration.py` to compare SQLite vs PostgreSQL row counts during dry runs.
  - Flipped the application default to PostgreSQL (`database.py`, `.env.example`) while keeping an explicit opt-in flag for legacy SQLite development.
- In Progress:
  - Awaiting execution of the new verification script once a Postgres instance is provisioned.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - Local environments must install SQLAlchemy before running the comparison script outside the project virtualenv.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Run the verification script after the first migration dry-run and capture results in the migration guide.

- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening
- Completed:
  - Authored a full migration runbook with rollback plan and checklists (`docs/internal/platform/POSTGRES_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`).
- In Progress:
  - Pending scheduling of dry-run using the new runbook and verification tooling.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None additional; ensure SQLAlchemy installed for the verification script when run outside the project venv.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Walk through the runbook in staging, then update the document with real timings.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - docs/internal/platform/POSTGRES_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md

## 2025-10-11 (Session 12) – Summary
- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening
- Completed:
  - Provisioned local PostgreSQL 15 service, created default `ward_admin` role, and applied the draft schema.
  - Updated migration tooling to handle UUID reflection, optional FK ordering, and added logging (`migrate_to_postgres.py`).
  - Successfully migrated data from `data/ward_ops.db` to PostgreSQL (`ward_ops` DB) and verified counts via `scripts/verify_postgres_migration.py`.
  - Adjusted schema (standalone device IP no longer unique, `monitoring_templates.is_builtin` added) to mirror live data.
  - Granted ownership of all tables/sequences to `ward_admin` for application use.
- In Progress:
  - Update environment/configuration to point running services at the new `DATABASE_URL`.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - None noted; ensure teams stop services before re-running migration in other environments.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Swap application `.env` to `postgresql://ward_admin:ward_admin_password@localhost:5432/ward_ops` and smoke test APIs/UI.
  - Capture the migration commands and verification output in the runbook appendix.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - migrate_to_postgres.py
  - migrations/postgres/001_core_schema.sql
  - docs/internal/platform/POSTGRES_SCHEMA_PLAN.md

## 2025-10-11 (Session 13) – Summary
- Workstream(s): UX Modernisation, Platform Hardening
- Completed:
  - Applied design-system Input/Select/Button variants to Devices and Monitor pages for consistent token usage (`frontend/src/pages/Devices.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Monitor.tsx`).
  - Documented ping telemetry index/retention strategy and added supporting SQL migration (`docs/internal/platform/PING_RESULTS_RETENTION.md`, `migrations/postgres/002_ping_results_indexes.sql`).
  - Added `scripts/start_dev_stack.sh` to launch API, Celery, and Vite frontend against PostgreSQL with one command.
  - Archived legacy SQLite database and reset Postgres sequences to avoid insert collisions.
- In Progress:
  - Roll out tokenised components to remaining legacy pages (e.g., Alert Rules, Dashboard).
- Blockers / Risks:
  - Celery worker still logs legacy alert-rule errors (AlertHistory missing fields); follow-up cleanup required.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Convert ping retention script into a scheduled Celery maintenance task.
  - Continue design-system adoption across remaining screens.
- Files / PRs touched:
  - frontend/src/pages/Devices.tsx

## 2025-10-12 (Session 14) – Summary
- Workstream(s): Platform Hardening, DevOps
- Completed:
  - Implemented CredoBank-specific CI pipeline that provisions a scratch Postgres/Redis, migrates data from SQLite, runs tests + Celery smoke, and builds/pushes Docker artifacts (`.github/workflows/credobank-ci.yml`).
  - Added reusable migration runner (`scripts/run_sql_migrations.py`) and Celery smoke test (`scripts/celery_smoke_test.py`) safeguards for seeded data.
  - Delivered deployment artifacts (`deploy/docker-compose.yml`, `.env.prod.example`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`) describing how to run the stack on a single VM.
  - Created tokenised Select/MultiSelect/Switch components and refreshed Alert Rules/Dashboard UIs to match the design system.
  - Adjusted API alerts route to surface new AlertHistory rows and proved alert visibility by seeding synthetic ping data.
- In Progress:
  - Monitoring VictoriaMetrics connectivity errors (worker warnings) – harmless locally but should be configured on CredoBank infra.
- Blockers / Risks:
  - CI pushes require registry credentials (`REGISTRY_USERNAME`/`REGISTRY_PASSWORD`) to be populated in GitHub secrets.
- Suggested Next Moves:
  - Integrate the new compose bundle into CredoBank’s VM and rotate default credentials post-deployment.
  - Enable metrics storage (VictoriaMetrics) or disable the client if not used to reduce log noise.
