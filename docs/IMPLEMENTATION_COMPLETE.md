# Host Group Configuration - Implementation Complete ✅

## Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Testing

All Phases 2-4 from HOSTGROUP_CONFIG_ROADMAP.md have been successfully implemented.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 2: API Endpoints ✅
Added 4 new API endpoints to [main.py](main.py):

1. **GET /api/v1/config/zabbix-hostgroups** (line 1035) - Fetch all host groups from Zabbix
2. **GET /api/v1/config/monitored-hostgroups** (line 1048) - Get currently monitored groups from DB
3. **POST /api/v1/config/monitored-hostgroups** (line 1068) - Save selected host groups (Admin only)
4. **GET /api/v1/config/georgian-cities** (line 1096) - Get Georgian cities with coordinates

### Phase 3: Configuration UI ✅
1. **Created templates/config.html** - Full configuration page with:
   - WARD-themed styling (#5EBBA8 green)
   - Host group selection grid with checkboxes
   - Display name customization per group
   - City-region mapping viewer (82 cities, 11 regions)
   - Real-time selection count
   - Success/error alerts

2. **Created static/js/config.js** - Interactive functionality:
   - Fetch Zabbix host groups on button click
   - Pre-select currently monitored groups
   - Toggle group selection with visual feedback
   - Save configuration with validation
   - Auto-load Georgian cities on page load
   - Alert notifications for success/errors

3. **Added route in main.py** (line 1031) - `/config` page route

### Phase 4: Dashboard Integration ✅
1. **Added hostname parsing function** (line 46):
   - `extract_city_from_hostname()` - Extracts city from formats like:
     - "Batumi-ATM" → "Batumi"
     - "Tbilisi1-NVR" → "Tbilisi"
     - "Batumi-ATM 10.199.96.163" → "Batumi"

2. **Updated dashboard stats endpoint** (line 135-270):
   - Fetches monitored groups from database
   - Filters devices by configured host groups
   - Extracts city names from hostnames
   - Looks up city coordinates from DB
   - Includes latitude/longitude in regional stats
   - Graceful fallback if no groups configured

## Database Schema (Already Created ✅)
- `monitored_hostgroups` - Stores selected host groups with display names
- `georgian_regions` - 11 Georgian regions with coordinates
- `georgian_cities` - 82 cities with lat/long coordinates

## Files Modified/Created
✅ [main.py](main.py) - Added 4 API endpoints, helper function, updated dashboard logic, /config route
✅ [templates/config.html](templates/config.html) - Configuration page UI
✅ [static/js/config.js](static/js/config.js) - Configuration page logic
✅ [templates/base.html](templates/base.html) - Added Config navigation link (admin only)
✅ [static/js/auth.js](static/js/auth.js) - Added visibility logic for Config link

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd "/Users/g.jalabadze/Desktop/WARD OPS/CredoBranches"
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

### 2. Access Configuration Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5001/config`

### 3. Configure Host Groups
1. Click "Fetch from Zabbix" button
2. Select desired host groups (checkboxes)
3. Optionally customize display names in text fields
4. Click "Save Configuration"
5. Success message confirms save

### 4. View Results on Dashboard
- Dashboard automatically filters to configured groups
- Regional stats include coordinates from DB
- City names extracted from device hostnames
- Map will use DB coordinates for visualization

## Key Features Implemented
✅ Admin-only configuration access (requires authentication)
✅ Real-time group selection with visual feedback
✅ Display name customization for each group
✅ Georgian geography integration (11 regions, 82 cities)
✅ Hostname parsing for automatic city extraction
✅ Database-driven coordinates for map visualization
✅ Backward compatibility (falls back to all devices if no config)
✅ WARD branding consistency (#5EBBA8 green throughout)
✅ Error handling and user feedback

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to /config page
- [ ] Fetch Zabbix host groups (button works)
- [ ] Select multiple groups (checkboxes)
- [ ] Customize display names
- [ ] Save configuration (admin only)
- [ ] Verify dashboard reflects configured groups
- [ ] Check regional stats include coordinates
- [ ] Test with no groups configured (fallback mode)
- [ ] Verify city extraction from various hostname formats

## Architecture Notes
- Uses SQLite for configuration persistence
- Coordinates stored in DB (no hardcoded values)
- Hostname parsing supports multiple formats
- Group filtering happens at API level
- User permissions still apply (region/branch restrictions)
- Asynchronous operations for better performance

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Update Add Device form to show only monitored groups
- [ ] Add bulk group assignment tool
- [ ] Create regional dashboard filters based on configured cities
- [ ] Add group analytics dashboard (devices per group, trends)
- [ ] Update map.js to use coordinates from regions_stats
