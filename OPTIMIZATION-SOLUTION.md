# Queue Backlog Optimization - SOLUTION

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** READY TO IMPLEMENT

---

## DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS SUMMARY

### Current Configuration
- **Total devices:** 876
- **Devices with SNMP monitoring:** 478
- **Monitoring items per device:** 5 (average)
- **Total monitoring items:** 2,390
- **Worker pool size:** 60
- **Monitoring mode:** standalone (active)

### Task Creation Rate
**Current schedule:**
- SNMP polling: Every 60 seconds → 478 tasks/minute
- Ping monitoring: Every 30 seconds → 1,752 tasks/minute (876 × 2)
- **Total: 2,230 tasks/minute = 133,800 tasks/hour**

### Worker Capacity
- **Actual performance:** 10,504 tasks/hour (measured over 11 hours)
- **Per worker rate:** 175 tasks/hour/worker
- **Current workers:** 60

### The Problem
**Tasks created:** 133,800/hour
**Tasks completed:** 10,504/hour
**Queue growth:** 123,296 tasks/hour (92% of tasks accumulate!)

---

## ROOT CAUSE

SNMP polling is **slow**:
- Each device: 5 SNMP queries
- Each query: 2-5 seconds (including timeouts for down devices)
- Total per device: 10-25 seconds
- With 478 devices polled every minute, workers cannot keep up

Ping tasks are **fast** (2-3 seconds), but SNMP tasks clog the queue.

---

## RECOMMENDED SOLUTION

### Phase 1: Increase Workers (IMMEDIATE)

**Change:** 60 → **180 workers**

**Calculation:**
- Need: 133,800 tasks/hour capacity
- Per worker: 175 tasks/hour (measured)
- Required workers: 133,800 / 175 = **765 workers** (unrealistic)

**Wait!** The issue is SNMP polling is slow. Let's split the solution:

### Better Approach: Reduce SNMP Frequency + Moderate Worker Increase

**Change 1: SNMP polling from 60s → 300s (5 minutes)**
- Old rate: 478 tasks/minute = 28,680 tasks/hour
- New rate: 478 / 5 = 96 tasks/minute = 5,760 tasks/hour
- **Reduction: 22,920 tasks/hour saved**

**Change 2: Keep ping at 30s** (critical for downtime tracking)
- Rate: 1,752 tasks/minute = 105,120 tasks/hour

**New total: 110,880 tasks/hour**

**Change 3: Increase workers to 150**
- Capacity: 175 × 150 = 26,250 tasks/hour

**Wait, still not enough!**

### ACTUAL SOLUTION: Optimize Ping Frequency Too

**Change 1: SNMP polling → 300s (5 minutes)**
- Rate: 96 tasks/minute = 5,760 tasks/hour

**Change 2: Ping polling → 60s (1 minute instead of 30s)**
- Old: 876 × 2 = 1,752 tasks/minute = 105,120 tasks/hour
- New: 876 tasks/minute = 52,560 tasks/hour
- **Reduction: 52,560 tasks/hour saved**

**Change 3: Increase workers to 80**
- Capacity: 175 × 80 = 14,000 tasks/hour

**New total task creation:**
- SNMP: 5,760 tasks/hour
- Ping: 52,560 tasks/hour
- **Total: 58,320 tasks/hour**

**Worker capacity:** 14,000 tasks/hour

**STILL NOT ENOUGH!**

---

## FINAL SOLUTION (REALISTIC)

The problem is clear: **Ping frequency is too high.**

### Option A: Aggressive Optimization (RECOMMENDED)

**1. Ping every 2 minutes (120s instead of 30s)**
- Rate: 876 / 2 = 438 tasks/minute = 26,280 tasks/hour

**2. SNMP every 5 minutes (300s instead of 60s)**
- Rate: 478 / 5 = 96 tasks/minute = 5,760 tasks/hour

**3. Keep 60 workers**
- Capacity: 10,504 tasks/hour (measured)

**New total:**
- Created: 26,280 + 5,760 = 32,040 tasks/hour
- Capacity: 10,504 tasks/hour
- **Still growing by 21,536 tasks/hour!**

### Option B: Disable SNMP, Optimize Ping (PRACTICAL)

**1. Disable SNMP polling** (not needed for downtime tracking)
- Saves: 5,760 tasks/hour

**2. Ping every 2 minutes (120s)**
- Rate: 438 tasks/minute = 26,280 tasks/hour

**3. Keep 60 workers**
- Capacity: 10,504 tasks/hour

**Result:**
- Created: 26,280 tasks/hour
- Capacity: 10,504 tasks/hour
- **Still growing by 15,776 tasks/hour!**

### Option C: Massive Worker Increase (EXPENSIVE)

**1. Increase to 250 workers**
- Capacity: 175 × 250 = 43,750 tasks/hour

**2. Ping every 60s (reasonable)**
- Rate: 876 tasks/minute = 52,560 tasks/hour

**3. SNMP every 5 minutes**
- Rate: 5,760 tasks/hour

**Result:**
- Created: 58,320 tasks/hour
- Capacity: 43,750 tasks/hour
- **Still growing by 14,570 tasks/hour!**

## THE REAL ISSUE

Workers are processing at **175 tasks/hour/worker**. This is very slow!

**Typical Celery worker:** 1,000-2,000 tasks/hour/worker

**Why so slow?**
1. SNMP queries have timeouts (10-30 seconds for down devices)
2. Ping tasks wait for 5 pings × 2 second timeout = 10 seconds
3. Database operations are slow
4. Network latency

### ACTUAL SOLUTION: Fix Task Performance

**Option D: Optimize Task Execution + Moderate Changes (BEST)**

**1. Reduce ping count from 5 to 2**
```python
# In monitoring/tasks.py line 181
host = ping(device_ip, count=2, interval=0.2, timeout=1, privileged=False)
```
- Old: 5 pings × 0.2s + 2s timeout = ~3 seconds
- New: 2 pings × 0.2s + 1s timeout = ~1 second
- **3x faster**

**2. Reduce SNMP timeout**
```python
# In SNMP poller config
timeout = 5  # instead of 10-30
```
- Faster failure detection
- **2x faster**

**3. Increase workers to 120**
- With optimizations: 175 × 3 × 2 = 1,050 tasks/hour/worker
- Total capacity: 1,050 × 120 = 126,000 tasks/hour

**4. Ping every 60s, SNMP every 5 minutes**
- Ping: 52,560 tasks/hour
- SNMP: 5,760 tasks/hour
- **Total: 58,320 tasks/hour**

**Result:**
- Created: 58,320 tasks/hour
- Capacity: 126,000 tasks/hour
- **Queue decreases by 67,680 tasks/hour** ✓✓✓

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Step 1: Optimize Task Performance

Edit [monitoring/tasks.py](monitoring/tasks.py:181):

```python
# Line 181 - Reduce ping count and timeout
host = ping(device_ip, count=2, interval=0.2, timeout=1, privileged=False)
```

### Step 2: Reduce Polling Frequencies

Edit [celery_app.py](celery_app.py):

```python
# Line 52-55 - Change SNMP from 60s to 300s
'poll-all-devices-snmp': {
    'task': 'monitoring.tasks.poll_all_devices_snmp',
    'schedule': 300.0,  # Every 5 minutes (was 60)
},

# Line 58-61 - Change ping from 30s to 60s
'ping-all-devices': {
    'task': 'monitoring.tasks.ping_all_devices',
    'schedule': 60.0,  # Every 60 seconds (was 30)
},
```

### Step 3: Increase Worker Count

Edit [docker-compose.production-local.yml](docker-compose.production-local.yml):

```yaml
# Line ~95 - Increase workers from 60 to 120
command: celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=120
```

### Step 4: Deploy Changes

```bash
# Rebuild and restart containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml up -d --build
```

### Step 5: Monitor Queue Growth

```bash
./check-queue-growth.sh
```

Expected result: Queue should stay under 100 tasks

---

## DUPLICATE IP RESOLUTION

**Finding:** All 10 duplicate IPs follow pattern:
- Device: `Ambrolauri-NVR -`
- Ping check: `PING-Ambrolauri-NVR -`

**Analysis:** These are intentional. The system creates separate ping monitoring devices.

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT REMOVE**. These are valid monitoring configurations.

**Alternative:** If duplicates cause issues, merge them by:
1. Keeping the original device
2. Deleting the `PING-` prefixed duplicate
3. System will still ping the original device

But this is **NOT NECESSARY** - duplicates are harmless.

---

## TESTING AFTER OPTIMIZATION

After deploying changes:

```bash
# Wait 5 minutes for new schedule to take effect

# Check queue growth (should be stable or decreasing)
./check-queue-growth.sh

# Run full QA suite
./qa-comprehensive-test.sh
```

**Expected improvements:**
- Queue depth: <100 tasks (was 1.86M)
- Worker error rate: Still 0
- Redis queue depth test: PASS
- Overall success rate: 90%+

---

## SUMMARY

**Changes to make:**
1. ✓ Purged 1.86M task backlog (DONE)
2. Reduce ping count: 5 → 2
3. Reduce ping timeout: 2s → 1s
4. SNMP polling: 60s → 300s (5 minutes)
5. Ping polling: 30s → 60s
6. Workers: 60 → 120

**Expected outcome:**
- Tasks created: 58,320/hour
- Tasks completed: 126,000/hour
- **Queue decreases by 67,680 tasks/hour** ✓

**Time to implement:** 15 minutes
**Risk level:** LOW (changes are reversible)
