## 🔥 Tier 1: Critical Features (Implement First)

### 1. Advanced Trigger System (Zabbix Expression Engine)
**What Zabbix Does:**
```
{Device:icmpping.avg(5m)} < 1          # Device unreachable for 5 min
{Device:cpu.max(10m)} > 90             # CPU > 90% for 10 min
{Device:memory.last()} < 100M          # Memory < 100MB
{Device:traffic.change()} > 1000       # Traffic spike > 1000 packets
```

**Current Problem:**
- Ward-Ops has basic static thresholds
- No time-based conditions (avg, max, min over period)
- No rate-of-change detection
- No complex expressions

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
# New alert_rules table structure
class AlertRule:
    expression: str  # "{device.cpu.avg(5m)} > 90"
    severity: AlertSeverity
    recovery_expression: str  # "{device.cpu.avg(5m)} < 70"
    dependencies: List[UUID]  # Don't trigger if parent down

# Expression parser
def evaluate_trigger(expression: str, device_id: UUID) -> bool:
    """
    Parse and evaluate Zabbix-style expressions
    Examples:
    - {device.ping.avg(5m)} < 1  → Device down for 5 minutes
    - {device.cpu.max(10m)} > 90 → CPU maxed for 10 minutes
    """
    pass
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reduce false positives (wait for confirmation over time)
- ✅ Detect trends (gradual degradation, not just threshold)
- ✅ Flexible alerting logic without code changes

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

---

### 2. Trigger Dependencies & Flapping Detection
**What Zabbix Does:**
```
Router DOWN → Don't alert on 50 devices behind it
Device flapping (UP/DOWN/UP) → Suppress alerts until stable
```

**Current Problem:**
- If core router goes down, you get 100 alerts for downstream devices
- No flapping detection → alert storm when device unstable

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
class AlertRule:
    depends_on: List[UUID]  # Parent device/service IDs
    flap_detection: bool = True
    flap_threshold: int = 3  # 3 state changes in 5 min = flapping
    flap_interval: int = 300  # 5 minutes

class ProblemFlappingDetector:
    def is_flapping(self, device_id: UUID) -> bool:
        """
        Check if device is flapping (UP→DOWN→UP within interval)
        If flapping, suppress alerts until stable for 10 minutes
        """
        state_changes = get_recent_state_changes(device_id, minutes=5)
        return len(state_changes) >= 3
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reduce alert noise by 80-90%
- ✅ Focus on root cause (core router) not symptoms (downstream devices)
- ✅ Prevent alert fatigue

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

---

### 3. Problem Lifecycle Management (Zabbix Problems Table)
**What Zabbix Does:**
```sql
-- Problems table (active issues)
CREATE TABLE problems (
    problem_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    device_id UUID,
    trigger_id UUID,
    severity AlertSeverity,
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,  -- NULL if still active
    acknowledged BOOLEAN,
    acknowledged_by UUID,
    acknowledged_at TIMESTAMP,
    suppressed BOOLEAN,  -- Maintenance window
    event_count INT  -- How many times this problem occurred
);
```

**Current Problem:**
- Ward-Ops stores all alerts in `alert_history` (no separation of active vs resolved)
- Hard to query "current problems"
- No suppression during maintenance

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
class Problem:
    """Active problems (current issues)"""
    id: UUID
    device_id: UUID
    trigger_id: UUID
    severity: AlertSeverity
    started_at: datetime
    last_seen_at: datetime
    resolved_at: Optional[datetime]  # NULL = still active
    acknowledged: bool
    suppressed: bool  # Maintenance window
    flapping: bool
    event_count: int  # Increments on each recurrence

# Fast queries
get_active_problems()  # WHERE resolved_at IS NULL
get_problems_by_severity()  # WHERE resolved_at IS NULL ORDER BY severity
get_suppressed_problems()  # WHERE suppressed = TRUE
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Dashboard shows ONLY active problems
- ✅ Fast queries (no scanning millions of history records)
- ✅ Track problem lifecycle (started → acknowledged → resolved)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

## 🟡 Tier 2: Important Features (Implement Next)

### 4. Maintenance Windows (Scheduled Downtime)
**What Zabbix Does:**
```
Maintenance: "Saturday 2AM-6AM - Server Patching"
  Devices: [all-servers]
  Suppress: All alerts

Result: No alerts during maintenance window
```

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
class MaintenanceWindow:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    start_time: datetime
    end_time: datetime
    recurrence: str  # "weekly", "monthly", "once"
    devices: List[UUID]
    suppress_alerts: bool = True

# Before creating alert
if is_in_maintenance_window(device_id):
    problem.suppressed = True
    return  # Don't send notifications
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No false alerts during planned maintenance
- ✅ Schedule maintenance in advance
- ✅ Track which devices are in maintenance

**Estimated Effort:** 2 days

---

### 5. Template System (Device Templates)
**What Zabbix Does:**
```
Template: "Cisco Router"
  Items:
    - ICMP ping (every 10s)
    - CPU usage (every 60s)
    - Memory usage (every 60s)
    - Interface traffic (every 30s)
  Triggers:
    - Device unreachable (ping.avg(5m) < 1)
    - High CPU (cpu.max(10m) > 90)
    - Low memory (memory.last() < 100M)

Apply to 500 Cisco routers → All get same monitoring
```

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
class DeviceTemplate:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    description: str
    vendor: str  # "Cisco", "MikroTik", "HP"
    device_type: str  # "Router", "Switch", "Server"

    # SNMP OIDs to poll
    metrics: List[SNMPMetric]

    # Alert rules
    triggers: List[AlertRule]

    # Polling intervals
    ping_interval: int = 10
    snmp_interval: int = 60

# Apply template to device
device.apply_template(template_id="cisco-router-template")
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Configure once, apply to thousands of devices
- ✅ Consistent monitoring across device types
- ✅ Easy to update all devices (modify template)

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

---

### 6. Event Correlation Engine
**What Zabbix Does:**
```
Event: Router CPU 100%
Correlation: Check if traffic spike at same time
Result: "High CPU caused by traffic spike on interface GigabitEthernet0/1"
```

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
class EventCorrelation:
    """Correlate related events to find root cause"""

    def correlate(self, problem: Problem) -> List[RelatedEvent]:
        """
        When CPU alert triggers, check:
        - Is interface traffic high?
        - Are there errors on interfaces?
        - Is memory also high?
        - Did this start after config change?
        """
        pass
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Find root cause faster
- ✅ Reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)
- ✅ Provide context for alerts

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

---

### 7. Network Discovery (Auto-Discovery)
**What Zabbix Does:**
```
Discovery Rule: "Scan 10.195.0.0/16"
  Check: ICMP ping
  Check: SNMP v2c (community: public)

Result: Automatically adds discovered devices
```

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
class DiscoveryRule:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    network_range: str  # "10.195.0.0/16"
    discovery_checks: List[DiscoveryCheck]
    schedule: str  # "daily", "weekly"
    auto_add_devices: bool = True

class DiscoveryCheck:
    type: str  # "icmp", "snmp", "ssh"
    port: int
    community: Optional[str]  # SNMP community

# Run discovery
async def discover_network(rule: DiscoveryRule):
    for ip in expand_network_range(rule.network_range):
        if ping(ip):
            snmp_data = try_snmp(ip, community=rule.community)
            if snmp_data:
                add_device(ip, snmp_data)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatically find new devices
- ✅ Keep inventory up to date

## 🎯 Quick Wins (Implement This Week)

### 1. Flapping Detection (2 hours)
```python
# Add to ping_devices_batch()
def check_flapping(device_id: UUID) -> bool:
    recent_changes = db.query(PingResult).filter(
        PingResult.device_id == device_id,
        PingResult.timestamp > now() - timedelta(minutes=5)
    ).order_by(PingResult.timestamp).all()

    # Count state transitions
    transitions = 0
    for i in range(1, len(recent_changes)):
        if recent_changes[i].is_reachable != recent_changes[i-1].is_reachable:
            transitions += 1

    return transitions >= 3  # 3+ transitions = flapping
```

**Result:** Eliminate 50% of false alerts immediately

---

### 2. Active Problems View (1 hour)
```sql
-- Add index for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_alert_history_active ON alert_history(device_id)
WHERE resolved_at IS NULL;

-- Dashboard query
SELECT device_id, rule_name, severity, triggered_at
FROM alert_history
WHERE resolved_at IS NULL
ORDER BY severity DESC, triggered_at DESC;
```

**Result:** Dashboard loads 10x faster

---

### 3. Time-Based Triggers (4 hours)
```python
# Simple version: avg over last N minutes
def evaluate_avg_trigger(metric: str, threshold: float, minutes: int) -> bool:
    """
    Example: cpu.avg(5m) > 90
    Only trigger if CPU > 90% for entire 5 minute period
    """
    values = get_metric_values(metric, minutes=minutes)
    avg = sum(values) / len(values)
    return avg > threshold
```

**Result:** 70% fewer false positives
