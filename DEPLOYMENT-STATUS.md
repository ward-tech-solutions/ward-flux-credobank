# WARD OPS CredoBank - Deployment Status

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Server**: 10.30.25.39 (`/home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank`)
**Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED

---

## Deployment Summary

### ‚úÖ What Was Deployed

**3 Critical Fixes Deployed:**

1. **Server-Side Deployment Script** (`deploy-on-server.sh`)
   - Auto-detects deployment path (`/home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank` or `/root/ward-ops-credobank`)
   - Uses `docker-compose down` for proper container cleanup
   - Creates automatic backups before deployment
   - Commit: `25c173f`, `029a5e5`

2. **Container Cleanup Fix**
   - Changed from `docker-compose stop` to `docker-compose down`
   - Prevents "container name already in use" errors
   - Ensures clean deployments
   - Commit: `029a5e5`

3. **Timezone Error Fix** (`monitoring/tasks.py:227`)
   - Fixed crash: `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`
   - Handles both timezone-aware and timezone-naive `down_since` timestamps
   - Prevents ping task failures
   - Commit: `89978e3`

### ‚úÖ Verification Results

**System Health: EXCELLENT**

```
‚úÖ Containers: All running
‚úÖ API Health: Responding correctly
‚úÖ Celery Beat: Scheduling ping_all_devices every 30 seconds
‚úÖ Celery Workers: 50 workers processing tasks successfully
‚úÖ Ping Tasks: Executing and succeeding
‚úÖ Metrics: Being written to VictoriaMetrics ("Bulk write successful: 3 metrics")
‚úÖ No Timezone Errors: Fixed and verified
```

**Latest Logs (2025-10-22 09:16:36):**
```
[INFO] Task monitoring.tasks.ping_device succeeded in 0.22s
[INFO] Bulk write successful: 3 metrics
```

## Monitor Page Fix - Expected Behavior

### The Problem (BEFORE)
- Device "Khulo-881" and others showing "Down 16m" even when ping succeeds
- Zabbix resolves alert in 6 minutes
- WARD OPS continues showing DOWN for 16+ minutes
- `down_since` timestamp not being cleared when device comes UP

### The Solution (AFTER)
1. **Fixed timezone handling** - No more crashes when calculating downtime
2. **ALWAYS clear `down_since` when device is UP** (line 234 in `monitoring/tasks.py`)
3. **Immediate state updates** - Matches Zabbix behavior

### Expected Results
| Scenario | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Device pings successfully | Sometimes shows "Down Xm" | Immediately shows UP ‚úÖ |
| Device ping times out | Shows DOWN | Shows DOWN ‚úÖ |
| Device recovers | Shows DOWN for minutes after | Immediately shows UP ‚úÖ |
| Zabbix resolves in 6m | WARD OPS shows DOWN for 16m | WARD OPS shows UP in 6m ‚úÖ |

## State Transition Logs

### Why You Don't See `‚úÖ`/`‚ùå` Emoji Logs Yet

The `‚úÖ` and `‚ùå` emoji logs **only appear when device state CHANGES**:
- `‚ùå` = Device went from UP ‚Üí DOWN
- `‚úÖ` = Device went from DOWN ‚Üí UP

**Currently**: Most devices are stable (staying UP or staying DOWN), so no transition logs appear.

**To See Transition Logs**: Wait for a device to actually change state, or watch logs live:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs -f celery-worker | grep -E '‚úÖ|‚ùå'
```

**Proof Ping Tasks Are Working**:
```
Task monitoring.tasks.ping_device[...] succeeded in 0.22s: {
  'device_id': '...',
  'ip': '10.195.68.248',
  'is_alive': True,
  'avg_rtt': 6.956,
  'packet_loss': 0.0
}
```

## Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Deployment script works with correct path
- [x] Containers deployed successfully
- [x] No container name conflicts
- [x] Celery beat scheduling tasks
- [x] Celery workers executing tasks
- [x] Ping tasks succeeding
- [x] Metrics being written to VictoriaMetrics
- [x] No timezone errors in logs
- [x] API health endpoint responding

### üîÑ Pending User Verification
- [ ] **Monitor Page**: Check http://10.30.25.39:5001/monitor
  - Do devices show correct UP/DOWN status?
  - Is "Khulo-881" and similar devices showing correct status?
  - Are UP devices still incorrectly showing "Down Xm"?

## Quick Reference

### View Deployment Details
```bash
# On server
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank

# Check git version
git log -1 --oneline
# Expected: 89978e3 Fix timezone error in ping_device task

# Check container status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml ps

# Check recent logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs --tail=100 celery-worker
```

### Monitor Live Activity
```bash
# Watch state transitions (UP/DOWN changes)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs -f celery-worker | grep -E '‚úÖ|‚ùå'

# Watch successful ping tasks
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs -f celery-worker | grep "succeeded"

# Watch metrics being written
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs -f celery-worker | grep "Bulk write"
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

If Monitor page still shows incorrect status:

```bash
# On server
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank

# Find latest backup
ls -lt /home/wardops/ward-flux-backup-* | head -1

# Stop current deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml down

# Restore from backup
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml up -d
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Monitor Page** at http://10.30.25.39:5001/monitor
2. Check devices like "Khulo-881" - do they show correct status now?
3. If issues persist, check if `down_since` is being cleared in database
4. Monitor logs for state transitions: `docker-compose logs -f celery-worker | grep -E '‚úÖ|‚ùå'`
