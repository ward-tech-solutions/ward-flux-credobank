## 📈 Scaling to 1,500+ Devices on 6 vCPU / 16GB RAM

**Current:** 875 devices
**Target:** 1,500+ devices
**Challenge:** Keep near real-time performance (10s intervals) on same hardware

---

## 📊 Load Analysis

### Task Volume at Scale

| Devices | Ping Batches (10s) | SNMP Batches (60s) | Total Tasks/Min | Worker Load |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **875** | 9 | 18 | 72 | ✅ Comfortable |
| **1,500** | 15 | 30 | 120 | ⚠️ **Will struggle** |
| **2,000** | 20 | 40 | 160 | ❌ **Overload** |

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 1: Increase Workers (Simple)

**For 1,500 devices - Recommended**

### Updated Configuration

**Workers: 53 total (from 33)**
- Alerts: 6 (no change)
- Monitoring: **25** (was 15) → handles 90 tasks/min
- SNMP: **20** (was 10) → handles 30 tasks/min
- Maintenance: 2 (no change)

### Resource Usage

**CPU:**
```
53 workers × 12% = 636% CPU
= ~6.4 CPU cores
= 106% of 6 vCPU ⚠️ Will run at 100%
```

**RAM:**
```
53 workers × 150 MB = 7.95 GB
+ PostgreSQL: 2 GB
+ Redis: 1 GB
+ API: 1 GB
+ OS: 1 GB
= 12.95 GB total ✅ 81% of 16GB
```

**Verdict:**
- ✅ Will work for 1,500 devices
- ⚠️ CPU at 100% (acceptable)
- ✅ RAM has headroom
- ✅ Simple config change

### Deployment

```bash
# Use 1,500-device configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-1500-devices.yml up -d

# Monitor performance
watch -n 5 'docker stats --no-stream'
```

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 2: Increase Batch Size (Better!)

**Keep 33 workers, make batches bigger**

### The Math

**Current (875 devices):**
```
Batch size: 100 devices
Batches: 875 / 100 = 9
Tasks: 9 × 6/min = 54 tasks/min
```

**Optimized (1,500 devices):**
```
Batch size: 150 devices
Batches: 1,500 / 150 = 10
Tasks: 10 × 6/min = 60 tasks/min
Only 11% more tasks!
```

### Implementation

Edit `monitoring/tasks_batch.py`:

```python
# Change from:
BATCH_SIZE = 100

# To:
BATCH_SIZE = 150
```

### Resource Usage

**Same as current:**
- CPU: 66% (4 cores)
- RAM: 62% (10 GB)
- Workers: 33

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No worker increase needed
- ✅ Same resource usage
- ✅ Only 11% more tasks
- ✅ Scales to 1,500 devices easily

**Trade-off:**
- Batches take slightly longer (7-10s vs 5-7s)
- But still completes within 10s interval ✅

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 3: Auto-Scaling Batches (Best!)

**Automatically adjust batch size based on device count**

### How It Works

```python
def calculate_optimal_batch_size(device_count):
    # Always aim for ~10 batches
    batch_size = device_count / 10
    return round_to_nearest_50(batch_size)

# Results:
# 875 devices → 100 per batch → 9 batches
# 1,500 devices → 150 per batch → 10 batches
# 3,000 devices → 300 per batch → 10 batches
```

### Implementation

Replace batch size calculation in `monitoring/tasks_batch.py`:

```python
# Old: Fixed batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 100

# New: Auto-scaling
device_count = len(devices)
BATCH_SIZE = calculate_optimal_batch_size(device_count)
logger.info(f"Auto-scaled batch size: {BATCH_SIZE} for {device_count} devices")
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Automatically adjusts to any device count
- ✅ Always keeps ~10 batches (optimal)
- ✅ No config changes needed
- ✅ Scales from 100 to 10,000+ devices
- ✅ Same resource usage

## 📊 Performance Comparison

### Solution Comparison

| Solution | Workers | CPU | RAM | Task/Min | Complexity |
|----------|---------|-----|-----|----------|------------|
| **Current (875)** | 33 | 66% | 62% | 72 | Simple |
| **Solution 1** (more workers) | **53** | **100%** | **81%** | 120 | Simple |
| **Solution 2** (bigger batches) | 33 | 66% | 62% | 80 | **Simple** ✅ |
| **Solution 3** (auto-scale) | 33 | 66% | 62% | 80 | Medium |

### Recommended: Solution 2 + Solution 3 Combined

**Use auto-scaling batches (Solution 3) with fallback to more workers if needed**

1. **Start with auto-scaling batches** (no config change)
2. **Monitor performance** for 1 week
3. **If queue builds up**, switch to Solution 1 (more workers)

## 🎯 Scaling Beyond 1,500 Devices

### Device Count Limits on 6 vCPU / 16GB

| Devices | Strategy | Workers | CPU | RAM | Status |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|-----|--------|
| **0-1,000** | Batch 100 | 33 | 66% | 62% | ✅ Comfortable |
| **1,000-2,000** | Batch 150-200 | 33-53 | 70-100% | 62-81% | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **2,000-3,000** | Batch 250-300 | 53-73 | 100% | 90% | ⚠️ At limit |
| **3,000+** | **Need more hardware** | - | - | - | ❌ Upgrade server |

### When to Upgrade Server

**Upgrade to 12 vCPU / 32GB when:**
- Device count exceeds 2,500
- CPU consistently at 100%
- Queue builds up > 500 tasks
- Alert delays > 30 seconds

## 🚀 Quick Start for 1,500 Devices

### Option A: Simple (More Workers)

```bash
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank
git pull origin main

# Use 1,500-device configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-1500-devices.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-1500-devices.yml up -d
```

### Option B: Optimal (Bigger Batches)

```bash
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank
git pull origin main

# Edit tasks_batch.py
nano monitoring/tasks_batch.py
# Change: BATCH_SIZE = 100 → BATCH_SIZE = 150

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-priority-queues.yml build celery-worker-monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-priority-queues.yml restart celery-worker-monitoring celery-beat
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations at 1,500 Devices

### With Solution 2 (Bigger Batches - RECOMMENDED)

**Ping Monitoring:**
```
Interval: Every 10 seconds
Batches: 10 (150 devices each)
Processing time: 7-10 seconds
All devices checked: Every 10 seconds ✅
```

**Alert Response:**
```
Device DOWN → Next ping: 0-10 seconds
Ping detects DOWN: 0 seconds
Alert evaluation: 0-10 seconds (next cycle)
Alert created: < 2 seconds

Total: 10-25 seconds ✅ Still near real-time!
```

**Resource Usage:**
```
CPU: 66-70% (comfortable)
RAM: 62-65% (plenty of headroom)
Queue size: 50-100 tasks (manageable)
Workers: 33 (same as current)
```
