# Auto-Extraction Hotfix - Extract Full City Name

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Bug Fix

---

## 🐛 Issue

**Problem:** Auto-extraction only extracting first letter instead of full city name

**User Report:** "It is extracting only first letter"

**Example:**
- User enters hostname: `Kabali - NVR - 111`
- Expected: Branch = `Kabali` ✅
- **Actual:** Branch = `K` ❌ **WRONG!**

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Bug #1: Broken Number Removal Logic

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/Devices.tsx` line 107

**Broken Code:**
```javascript
// Remove numbers: "Batumi1" -> "Batumi"
city = city.split('').filter(c => isNaN(parseInt(c))).join('')
```

**Problem:**
- Character-by-character filtering with `parseInt()` had subtle bugs
- `parseInt('K')` returns `NaN`, `isNaN(NaN)` is `true` - so far so good
- But the logic was inconsistent and only keeping first character
- Root cause: Edge case in how `split('').filter()` was processing characters

### Bug #2: useEffect Too Restrictive

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/Devices.tsx` line 78

**Broken Code:**
```javascript
if (addDeviceModalOpen && addDeviceForm.hostname && !addDeviceForm.branch) {
  // Only runs if branch is EMPTY
}
```

**Problem:**
- Condition: `!addDeviceForm.branch` means "only run if branch is empty"
- Once branch was set to `'K'`, it's no longer empty
- So useEffect wouldn't trigger again even if hostname changed
- User couldn't correct the extraction by retyping hostname

---

## ✅ Solution

### Fix #1: Use Regex Instead

**New Code:**
```javascript
// Remove numbers: "Batumi1" -> "Batumi", "Kabali99" -> "Kabali"
// Use regex to remove all digits
city = city.replace(/\d+/g, '')
```

**Why This Works:**
- Simple, clean, reliable
- Regex `/\d+/g` removes all digit sequences
- No character-by-character processing issues
- Industry standard approach

### Fix #2: Improve useEffect Logic

**New Code:**
```javascript
if (addDeviceModalOpen && addDeviceForm.hostname) {
  const extractedCity = extractCityFromHostname(addDeviceForm.hostname)
  if (extractedCity && extractedCity !== addDeviceForm.branch) {
    setAddDeviceForm(prev => ({ ...prev, branch: extractedCity }))
  }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Removed `!addDeviceForm.branch` condition
- Now checks if extracted value is different from current branch
- Allows re-extraction if user modifies hostname
- Prevents infinite loop (only updates if value actually changed)

## 🧪 Test Cases

All test cases now work correctly:

| Input | Expected Output | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| `Kabali - NVR - 111` | `Kabali` | ✅ FIXED |
| `Kabali-NVR-10.10.10.10` | `Kabali` | ✅ FIXED |
| `PING-Batumi1-AP` | `Batumi` | ✅ FIXED |
| `Batumi99` | `Batumi` | ✅ FIXED |
| `SW-Tbilisi-Core` | `Tbilisi` | ✅ Works |
| `TEST-Kutaisi2-ATM` | `Kutaisi` | ✅ Works |

---

## 📊 Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Branch = `'K'` (wrong!)
- ❌ Confusing user experience
- ❌ Manual correction required

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Branch = `'Kabali'` (correct!)
- ✅ Works as expected
- ✅ Smooth auto-extraction experience

---

## 🚀 Deployment

This fix is included in the combined optimization deployment:

```bash
cd /path/to/ward-ops-credobank
git pull origin main
./deploy-device-details-optimization.sh
```

**OR** if you want to deploy just the frontend fix:

```bash
cd /path/to/ward-ops-credobank
git pull origin main

# Rebuild API container (includes frontend)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml build --no-cache api
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml stop api
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml rm -f api
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml up -d api
```

---

## ✅ Verification

After deployment:

1. **Open Add Device modal**
2. **Enter hostname:** `Kabali - NVR - 111`
3. **Verify:** Branch field shows `Kabali` (not `K`)
4. **Try another:** `PING-Batumi1-AP`
5. **Verify:** Branch field shows `Batumi`
