# 🚨 EMERGENCY: COMPLETE MONITORING FAILURE

**Status:** ALL ALERTS MISSED TODAY
**Impact:** Zabbix catching everything, WARD OPS catching NOTHING
**Priority:** 🔥 CRITICAL - Production monitoring completely down

---

## 🔥 The Problem

**User Report:**
- "I missed all alerts and everything caught by Zabbix"
- "Our tool did not catch any new alert from today"
- "Zabbix also has 30s check interval"
- **"I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT ZABBIX CAUGHT ALERT AND IT IS NOT VISIBLE IN OUR TOOL!"**

This is NOT about one device - this is **COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE**.

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION (Run NOW)

### Step 1: Investigate What's Broken

```bash
# On Credo Bank server (via jump server)
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank
./investigate-monitoring-failure.sh
```

This will check:
1. ✅ How many pings in last 2 hours (should be ~240 per device)
2. ✅ When exactly monitoring stopped
3. ✅ Is Beat scheduling tasks?
4. ✅ Is Worker processing tasks?
5. ✅ Are there errors?
6. ✅ Is monitoring enabled?
7. ✅ How many devices should be monitored?

**Run this and send me the output immediately!**

## 🔍 Most Likely Causes

### Cause 1: Worker Crashed/Stopped Processing (Most Likely)
**Symptoms:**
- Beat scheduling tasks every 30s ✅
- Worker NOT processing tasks ❌
- No "Pinged" messages in worker logs
- Pings stopped at specific time

**Check:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs --tail 100 celery-worker | grep "Pinged"
```

**If 0 results:** Worker is not processing ping tasks!

**Emergency Fix:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml restart celery-worker celery-beat
```

---

### Cause 2: Database Connection Failure
**Symptoms:**
- Beat scheduling ✅
- Worker running ✅
- Database connection errors in logs ❌

**Check:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs --tail 200 celery-worker | grep -i "database\|connection"
```

**Emergency Fix:**
```bash
# Restart all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml restart celery-worker celery-beat postgres
```

---

### Cause 3: Monitoring Profile Disabled
**Symptoms:**
- No active monitoring profile
- ping_all_devices exits early

**Check:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec postgres psql -U wardops -d wardops -c \
  "SELECT id, name, is_active FROM monitoring_profiles;"
```

**If all is_active = false:**
```bash
# Enable monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec postgres psql -U wardops -d wardops -c \
  "UPDATE monitoring_profiles SET is_active = true WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM monitoring_profiles LIMIT 1);"
```

---

### Cause 4: Beat Scheduler Not Running
**Symptoms:**
- No scheduling messages in beat logs
- ping_all_devices not being scheduled

**Check:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs --tail 50 celery-beat | grep "ping-all-devices"
```

**If no output:**
```bash
# Restart beat
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml restart celery-beat
```

---

### Cause 5: Redis Queue Backed Up
**Symptoms:**
- Tasks being scheduled but not executing
- Redis memory full
- Tasks stuck in queue

**Check:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec redis redis-cli INFO memory
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec redis redis-cli LLEN celery
```

**If queue has 1000+ tasks:**
```bash
# Clear queue and restart
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml restart celery-worker celery-beat
```

---

## ⚡ NUCLEAR OPTION (If Investigation Takes Too Long)

**If you need monitoring back RIGHT NOW:**

```bash
cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank

# Full restart of monitoring stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml restart celery-worker celery-beat postgres redis

# Wait 30 seconds
sleep 30

# Verify monitoring started
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs --tail 50 celery-worker | grep "Pinged"
```

**Expected:** You should see "Pinged X.X.X.X" messages appearing every few seconds.

**Then wait 1 minute and check database:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec postgres psql -U wardops -d wardops -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(timestamp), NOW() - MAX(timestamp) FROM ping_results WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 minutes';"
```

**Expected:** Should show recent pings (< 1 minute ago).

---

## 📊 Verification After Fix

### 1. Check Pings Are Happening
```bash
# Should show increasing count every 30 seconds
watch -n 5 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec postgres psql -U wardops -d wardops -c "SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(timestamp) FROM ping_results WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '\''1 minute'\'';"'
```

### 2. Check Worker Logs
```bash
# Should show continuous ping activity
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs -f celery-worker | grep "Pinged"
```

### 3. Check Beat Logs
```bash
# Should show scheduling every 30 seconds
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs -f celery-beat | grep "ping-all-devices"
```

### 4. Verify Alerts Are Created
```bash
# Manually trigger a device down (disconnect or block ping)
# Then check alerts table
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec postgres psql -U wardops -d wardops -c \
  "SELECT device_id, rule_name, severity, message, triggered_at FROM alerts ORDER BY triggered_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis (After Emergency Fix)

Once monitoring is restored, we need to determine WHY it stopped:

### Questions to Answer:
1. **When did it stop?** (Check ping_results timestamp gaps)
2. **What happened at that time?** (Check system logs, deployments, restarts)
3. **Were there errors?** (Check worker/beat logs from that time)
4. **Was it gradual or sudden?** (All devices at once, or slowly?)

### Get Historical Data:
```bash
# Ping activity over last 24 hours
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml exec postgres psql -U wardops -d wardops -c \
  "SELECT date_trunc('hour', timestamp) as hour, COUNT(*) as pings
   FROM ping_results
   WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
   GROUP BY hour
   ORDER BY hour DESC;"
```

## 🛡️ Permanent Fixes (After Root Cause Found)

### If Worker Keeps Stopping:
- Add health check and auto-restart
- Increase worker memory limit
- Add worker monitoring

### If Database Connections Failing:
- Increase connection pool size
- Add connection retry logic
- Fix session management

### If Tasks Getting Stuck:
- Add task timeouts
- Clear old tasks periodically
- Monitor queue depth

### If Redis Issues:
- Increase Redis memory limit
- Add Redis persistence
- Monitor Redis memory usage

## 📞 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

**RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Run investigation script:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/wardops/ward-flux-credobank
   ./investigate-monitoring-failure.sh > monitoring-investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
   ```

2. **Send me the output** so I can see exactly what's broken

3. **If you need monitoring NOW:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml restart celery-worker celery-beat
   ```

4. **Verify it's working:**
   ```bash
   # Wait 1 minute, then check:
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-local.yml logs --tail 50 celery-worker | grep "Pinged"
   ```

**This is CRITICAL - monitoring is completely down!**

**Run the investigation script NOW and send me results!**
